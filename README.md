## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a visualization of bike sharing data, in order to appeal to potential investors. The data here used is from NYC, and we want to start a similar service in Des Moines, Iowa. These visualizations demonstrate data such as the duration of bike trips, and the relationships between gender, popular riding times etc.

## Summary

Based on the data, and our analysis of the data, it is clear that most of these users are work commuters, rather than tourists. The most popular times are during the morning and evening commute rush hours. This is beneficial for considering this service in Iowa, as there won't be many tourists in downtown Des Moines. I think additional visualizations would be helpful, particularly highlighting more residential areas in the city of New York. A comparison of population density would also be helpful.
